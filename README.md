This repository contains an AI-based Text Emotion Detector Web Application created as part of IBM's Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask course. Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides.
